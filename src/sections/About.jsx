            <p>
                I am a passionate <strong>Software Developer</strong> with a focus on building fast, scalable, and secure web applications. I enjoy crafting clean, user-friendly interfaces with React, while architecting robust backends using Spring Boot. From developing JWT-secured authentication systems to deploying Dockerized apps on Google Cloud, I take pride in owning the full development lifecycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I’m expanding my skills in DevOps, cloud architecture, and system design — aiming to build not just apps, but resilient platforms. I thrive on solving real-world problems, collaborating on projects, and continuously leveling up through hands-on learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it is designing intuitive UIs, managing cloud deployments, or optimizing APIs for performance — I’m always excited to take on the next challenge.
            </p>
            <p>Let’s build something great! ✨</p>
